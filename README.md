### citation to paper

bimEX is a [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) package making use of [xAct](http://www.xact.es/). Its goal is to provide a ready-to-use working framework in which one can manipulate the abstract bimetric equations in the 3+1 formalism, and compute them in any desired ansatz.

### Getting started

To use bimEX, download the file bimEX.m and load it into a Mathematica notebook as,

`<<"*path*/bimEX.m"`

This repository includes also the source file bimEX.nb and a working example bimEX_Working_Example.nb.

### Prerequisites

To run bimEX, you need to install Mathematica and the xAct bundle.

### Testing the package

To test the package, put the files bimEX.m and bimEX_Working_Example.nb in the same folder. Then open bimEX_Working_Example.nb and evaluate the notebook.
