### citation to paper

bimEX is a [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/) package making use of [xAct](http://www.xact.es/). Its goal is to provide a ready-to-use working framework in which one can manipulate the abstract bimetric equations in the 3+1 formalism, and compute them in any desired ansatz.

### Getting started

To use bimEX, download the file bimEX.m and load it into a Mathematica notebook as,

`<<"*path*/bimEX.m"`

This repository includes also the source file bimEX.nb, the working example bimEX_Working_Example.nb, and the two notebooks bimEX_Decomposition_Lists_Loader.nb and bimEX_Decomposition_xAct_Loader.

The notebook bimEX_Decomposition_Lists_Loader.nb loads the file Decomposition_Lists.m, whereas the notebook bimEX_Decomposition_xAct_Loader loads the file Decomposition_xAct.m. The two .m files are generated by bimEX_Working_Example.nb.

### Prerequisites

To run bimEX, you need to install Mathematica and the xAct bundle.

### Documentation

The documentation is provided in the form of **Usage messages** in Mathematica. They are accessible by typing

`?<name_of_function_or_option>`

in the Mathematica notebook. We also refer to the associated paper.

### Testing the package

To test the package, put the files bimEX.m and bimEX_Working_Example.nb in the same folder. Then open bimEX_Working_Example.nb and evaluate the notebook.
